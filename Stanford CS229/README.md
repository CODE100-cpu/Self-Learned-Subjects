# Course Description   This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. 
Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); 
unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice, and decisoin trees); 
reinforcement learning and adaptive control. Deep Learning. Neural networks. etc.

Currently have homeworks and projects left unfinished
