# Chapter 1: Vector spaces are defined in this chapter, and their basic properties
 are developed.
 # Chapter 2: Linear independence, span, basis, and dimension are defined in this
 chapter, which presents the basic theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces.
 # Chapter 3: This chapter introduces linear maps. The key result here is the
 fundamental theorem of linear maps: if 𝑇 is a linear map on 𝑉, then dim𝑉 =
 dimnull𝑇+dimrange𝑇. Quotient spaces and duality are topics in this chapter
 at a higher level of abstraction than most of the book; these topics can be
 skipped (except that duality is needed for tensor products in Section 9D).
 # Chapter 4: The part of the theory of polynomials that will be needed to un
derstand linear operators is presented in this chapter. This chapter contains no
 linear algebra. It can be covered quickly, especially if your students are already
 familiar with these results.
 # Chapter 5: The idea of studying a linear operator by restricting it to small sub
spaces leads to eigenvectors in the early part of this chapter. The highlight of this
 chapter is a simple proof that on complex vector spaces, eigenvalues always ex
ist. This result is then used to show that each linear operator on a complex vector
 space has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis. The minimal
 polynomial plays an important role here and later in the book. For example, this
 chapter gives a characterization of the diagonalizable operators in terms of the
 minimal polynomial. Section 5E can be skipped if you want to save some time.
 # Chapter 6: Inner product spaces are defined in this chapter, and their basic
 properties are developed along with tools such as orthonormal bases and the
 Gram–Schmidt procedure. This chapter also shows how orthogonal projections
 can be used to solve certain minimization problems. The pseudoinverse is then
 introduced as a useful tool when the inverse does not exist. The material on
 the pseudoinverse can be skipped if you want to save some time.
 # Chapter 7: The spectral theorem, which characterizes the linear operators for
 which there exists an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors, is one of
 the highlights of this book. The work in earlier chapters pays off here with espe
cially simple proofs. This chapter also deals with positive operators, isometries,
 unitary operators, matrix factorizations, and especially the singular value de
composition, which leads to the polar decomposition and norms of linear maps.
 # Chapter 8: This chapter shows that for each operator on a complex vector space,
 there is a basis of the vector space consisting of generalized eigenvectors of the
 operator. Then the generalized eigenspace decomposition describes a linear
 operator on a complexvector space. Themultiplicity of an eigenvalue is defined
 as the dimension of the corresponding generalized eigenspace. These tools are
 used to prove that every invertible linear operator on a complex vector space
 has a square root. Then the chapter gives a proof that every linear operator on
 a complex vector space can be put into Jordan form. The chapter concludes
 with an investigation of the trace of operators.
 # Chapter9: Thischapterbeginsbylookingatbilinearformsandshowingthatthe
 vector space of bilinear forms is the direct sum of the subspaces of symmetric
 bilinear forms and alternating bilinear forms. Then quadratic forms are diag
onalized. Moving to multilinear forms, the chapter shows that the subspace of
 alternating 𝑛-linear forms on an 𝑛-dimensional vector space has dimension one.
 This result leads to a clean basis-free definition of the determinant of an opera
tor. For complex vector spaces, the determinant turns out to equal the product of
 the eigenvalues, with each eigenvalue included in the product as many times as
 its multiplicity. The chapter concludes with an introduction to tensor products.
